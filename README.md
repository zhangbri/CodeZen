## Notes

- **Layout Type:** The code uses ConstraintLayout for flexible UI design, demonstrating efficient space and alignment management.
- **TextView Components:** It includes multiple TextView elements with customized fonts (@font/homemade_apple, @font/amiko), text size, color, and demonstrates both the use of string resources and hardcoded text for content.
- **TextAppearance Style:** Custom text appearance styles (@style/TextAppearance.Quote) are applied for consistent styling across different text views.
- **ConstraintLayout Positioning:** The layout showcases relative positioning features of ConstraintLayout to align components based on the parent or other elements, utilizing constraints and margins.
- **ImageView Component:** An ImageView is used to display a graphic, with attributes for size, source, and scaling set to enhance visual appeal.
